This plugin lets your WordPress display instant articles directly on your facebook page.

== Description ==

This Plugin creates a special RSS Feed for your Wordpress blog to harvest the power of Facebook Instant Articles.

Instant Articles is a new technology by Facebook that will load your webpage content „instant“. That means Facebook will cache your articles on Facebooks servers and will load them within the native FB iOS or Android App without opening a browserwindow and connecting to your webserver.

Instant Articles will likely be available in the Q1/2016 for most media sites. As of today it is in a limited beta test by big media companies like Buzzfeed, NYT or Spiegel Online.

You can learn more about Instant Articles on the official Facebook Developer Documentation at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles.

Attention: If you are not part of the limited beta test happening right now, this plugin will be useless for you. However it will help you to quick start and use the first mover effect the moment Facebooks opens Instant Articles for all publications.
