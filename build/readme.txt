This plugin integrates the free-images.cc image library directly into your media browser.

== Description ==

Over the last years the creative commons movement gained traction and more and more artists followed the trend of committing their work to public domain. We believe that this will contribute to making the web a better, more beautiful place.

But we don’t want to be one of many. There are several aspects, that will make [free-images.cc](http://www.free-images.cc) superior to many other sites out there. Not only do we curate the images and publish only the creme de la creme. Every image is carefully tagged for better discoverability and every photographer is named and honored.

Every free image uploaded here will be under the CC0 Public Domain license. So every image will be free to use for whatever purpose you want!

We are always keen for improvement and new artists, that publish their work under the creative commons public domain license. If you have any feedback or tips for great, free images, drop us a mail at contact@free-images.cc!
